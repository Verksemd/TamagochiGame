A pet - potentially any creature imaginable, but at the start it'll be a dog

If we have a desktop app, we should 1) save the state 2) make the pet hungry, sad, etc. when the
game is off?

hunger, happiness, cleanliness, and sleep -- status indicators for every of them
needs should degrade over time, requiring player attention at intervals

* if a certain need is overly met (e.g. the pet is starved), then it affects its appearance

interaction: player should be able to feed, play with, clean, and put the pet to sleep.

reward system: for good care, player gets gems to spend on cosmetics

* allow to enhance a current real life pet with customization of needs
* make mobile
